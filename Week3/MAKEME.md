## **1. Practice the concepts**

Before we head into the assignment, it might be nice to do some interactive exercises first! In the following resource you'll find some exercises that'll teach you all about higher order and array functions!

- [Learn JavaScript: Higher Order Functions](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/higher-order-functions/exercises/introduction)
- [Learn JavaScript: Iterators](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/javascript-iterators/exercises/intro)

## **2. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your cohort and your Q&A mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `JavaScript` fork, go to the folder `Week3`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **3. Assignment**

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (JavaScript / Week 3). Have a look at the [assignment guide](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/blob/main/hand-in-assignments-guide.md) to see how to hand in your assignment.

_NOTE: do NOT forget to checkout the main branch before creating the branch for this week. Otherwise your previous assignment will be a part of the PR_

## **4. Extra: Challenges (Optional)**

Have a look at the challenges folder in this repository to try some harder problems. We expect these to be hard, so take your time to try and solve them yourself. If you really can't figure it out then have a look at the solutions, but it usually sticks better if you find the solution yourself.

Also keep going with all of the from beginner to advanced platforms mentioned last week!

## Finished?

Try to do more exercises in the links above. The first weeks of the JavaScript modules are very important as understanding the basics will make the rest of the curriculum that much easier to follow. So keep reading and writing code!
