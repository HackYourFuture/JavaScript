# Prep exercise - HackYourFuture program

This week is all about combining everything we know and learning how to solve problems. To help with that, we're going to do some exercises using the data structure of the HackYourFuture program we made in week 1. As it is a prep exercise, it is something you can do together to get to the solution! Have a look at the `index.js` file for the instructions.

## Things to think about

After completing the exercise, have a think about the following things:

- We split the functions into multiple files. Why do you think we do that?
- Note how some functions can be used by others to solve its problem. A lot of times when we are stuck in programming it is because we are trying to solve everything at once. It then helps to split the problem up into steps!
