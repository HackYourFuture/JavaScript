 * We would like to have a list of everyone that is currently participating in a class.

 * - Check what the `currentModule` of the class is
 * - Find the mentor(s) that are `nowTeaching` that module
 *
 * Should return the list of names and their roles. So something like:
 *
 *  [{ name: 'John', role: 'student' }, { name: 'Mary', role: 'mentor' }]
