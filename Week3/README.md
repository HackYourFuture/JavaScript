# Reading Material JavaScript Week 3

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 3:

1. [Higher Order Functions](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/higher-order-functions)
   - Array methods
1. [Closures](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/closures)
   - Execution context
   - Why do we need closures?
1. [Unit testing](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/testing/unit-tests)
   - [Testing framework (Jest)](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/tools/test-framework)

## Week goals

This week we are going to keep practicing coding and introducing a few more advanced topics that you will encounter. Firstly, higher order functions are a way functions are being used regularly in the real world, most notably in the methods `Array`'s provide us. Read all about it [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/higher-order-functions). Our graduates recommend to spend extra time learning the `Array` methods as they are a huge part of solving problems.

Secondly, JavaScript has a thing called closures which you should know about. You will most likely not encounter issues with them any time soon, but it is good to have in the back of your mind that this exists. So read all about them [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/closures).

Previously, we learned about the `assert` function which allow us to make code checks, but that is only the start. For consistent testing we developers write something we call unit tests, have a look at what that means [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/testing/unit-tests). Then have a look at test frameworks and what they can do over [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/tools/test-framework). Note that in our curriculum we will always be using _Jest_ as it is very popular and works well with React which we will be studying later. Behind the scenes we have been testing your homework with Jest all this time and it is where the error messages when running your homework comes from!

After that it is time to start practicing again, make as many exercises as you can in the list [here](./MAKEME.md) and don't forget to hand in your homework. There will also be a test coming up for this module. What and when will be announced in your class channel, so keep an eye on that as usual! The best way to prepare is to keep programming!
