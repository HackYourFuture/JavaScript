# Q & A session

The third week is all about more complex JavaScript topics. By now the trainees should have the basics down, so expect some tougher questions. Expect questions about:

- Higher Order Functions
- _Closures_
- The Debugger (both browser/vscode) and how to debug functions

We have noticed that Closures are tough for the trainees, so try to spend any time you have spare on that topic. Also try to keep using the debugger to show what happens line by line!
