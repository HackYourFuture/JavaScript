/** 
 * Follow the commented steps to write a piece of code.
 */

// 1. Declare variable and assign to it an empty array. Make sure that the name of the variable indicates it contains more than 1 item. For example items instead of item.
let items = [];

// 2. Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
console.log("it has undefined value yet");

// 3. Write a console.log statement that logs the array.

console.log(items);
// 4. Create a new variable with an array that has 3 of your favorite animals, each in a different string. Make sure the name of the variables says something about what the variable contains.
let animal =['lion','tiger','bear'];

// 5. Write a console.log statement that logs the second array.
console.log(animal);

// 6. Add a statement that adds another string ("Piglet)" to the array of animals.
animal.unshift('elephant');

// 7. Write a console.log statement that logs the second array!

console.log(animal);
