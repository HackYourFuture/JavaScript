/**
 * Follow the commented steps to write a piece of code
 */

 // 1. Declare a variable z and assign the number 7.25 to it.


 // 2. Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of z.


 // 3. Declare another variable a that has the value of z but rounded to the nearest integer.


 // 4. Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of a.


 // 5. So now we have z and a find a way to compare the two values and log true if a is greater than z or false if a is smaller than z.
