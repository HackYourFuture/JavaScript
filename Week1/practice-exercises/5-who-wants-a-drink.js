 * You're at a party and you feel thirsty! However, you've got 5 friends who are also in need of a drink. Let's go get them a drink.

 * Create a loop that runs 5 times. On each iteration, push a drink into the drinkTray variable. The drinkTray can only hold at most two instances of the same drink type, for example it can only hold 2 colas, 2 lemonades, 2 waters.
 * 
 * Log to the console: "Hey guys, I brought a [INSERT VALUES FROM ARRAY]!" (For example: "Hey guys, I brought a cola, cola, lemonade, lemonade, water!")
