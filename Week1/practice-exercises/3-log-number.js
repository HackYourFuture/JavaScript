// 1. Declare your variable numberX. Do not initialize it (which means, don't give it a starting value) yet


// 2. Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of x is


// 3. Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX.


// 4. Now initialize your variable numberX with a number (also called an integer in computer science terms)


// 5. Next, add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of numberX is


// 6. Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX

let numberX ;
console.log('I think it has no value yet & is undefined.');
console.log(numberX);
numberX = 8 ;
console.log('Now I think it\'s 8 as we initialized it.');
console.log(numberX);
