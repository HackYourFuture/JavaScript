// 1. Declare a variable myString and assign a string to it. Use your full name, including spaces, as the content for the string.
let myString = 'Sina Gholipour';

// 2. Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
console.log('I think the content of it is string data type & is my Name.');

// 3. Now console.log the variable myString.
console.log(myString);

// 4. Now reassign to the variable myString a new string.

myString = 'Sina Boby'; 
// 5. Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.

console.log('I think the value is the second string which I just assigned to it');
// 6. Now console.log myString again.

console.log(myString);
