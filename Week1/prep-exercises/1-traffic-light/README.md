# Prep exercise - traffic light

Let's have a deeper look at the working of traffic lights this week so that we can practice logic and loops. In `traffic-light-1.js` and `traffic-light-2.js` you will find the same requirements but with different ways of representing the traffic light. Have a look through the files and solve them so you can see how the way we represent data affects the way we need to solve problems.

## Things to think about

- Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?
  - the second way of representation is better because it resulted in shorter code as we avoided the 2 if blockes which we needed to change the color in traffic-light-1.
- What happens if you change the loop to a `do-while` loop instead of a `while` loop? Why?
  -do-while loop always executes once at the beginning before checking the condition, but in this case since the condition is true and the while loop is also executing the statements there is no difference.
- We could have also used a `for` loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not?
  -I think both loops can get the job done and I can say one is better than the other.
