/**
 * Have you ever wondered how old the HackYourFuture team members are? Or better yet: what the collective age is? Let's find out!
 * 
 *  Write a program that calculates the combined age of every member
 *  Make use of the map function to get the ages
 *  It should contain a function that takes a callback
 *  The callback adds all the ages together and returns the number
 *  The main function should log the string "The collective age of the HYF team is: [number]" to the console, and afterwards return the number
