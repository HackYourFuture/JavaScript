## **Todo list**

1. Practice practice practice (for the test)

## **1. Reinforce the concepts**

Go through the following article that has examples for all of the things you learned about this week combined (and a couple of extras):

- [Overview with examples](./overview.ipynb)

## **2. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your class and your Q&A mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `JavaScript` fork, go to the folder `Week4`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **3. Practice practice practice (for the test)**

At the end of this week (Tuesday most likely, but keep an eye on your class channel for the exact date) there will be a test. You will have received a practice test already and should have seen that what is most important is being able to translate a description of a problem to a solution in JavaScript. This is what a lot of the job is and is also becoming a bigger factor in applying to companies where these kind of exercises are part of the admission process.

So take the rest of the week to keep working on those beginner to advanced websites and practice these skills!

Good luck on the test!

## No homework to hand in this week

For the last week of JavaScript there is no homework to hand in as we want you to focus on practicing for the test.
