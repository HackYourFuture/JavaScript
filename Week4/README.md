   - The `new` keyword

## Week goals

This week we are going to keep practicing coding and introducing the last few intricacies of JavaScript that you will encounter a couple of times later on in the curriculum. These are good to know about but you will not be working with these a lot so don't worry too much about fully understanding every detail. You can come back to this at the point you will need them.

Let's start with the `this` keyword, it is a little tricky and sporadically you will want to use the context it provides. Have a look at what it means over [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/this).

Next let's learn about constructor functions which is why we have the `new` keyword. You have probably used it already but it is good to know what it does behind the scenes. Go through [this article](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/constructor-functions).

Lastly let's learn about classes which is another modern JavaScript addition to the language. Have a look [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/classes).

After that it is all about practicing for the test :scream: at the end of this week. You will have received a practice test in your class channel that will show you what it is about.
