# Reading Material JavaScript Week 2

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 2:

1. [Scope](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/scope)
1. [Modern JS](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/modern-js)
1. [Problem solving](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/problem-solving-process)

## Week goals

Functions bring along with them a concept called the scope that you may have encountered a bit already but we want to explicitly explain now. Read about scope [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/scope).

We have to confess we also kept something else from you until now, JavaScript has different versions. JavaScript has been evolving over its lifetime and certain syntax has been added. Have a look in your study book at the topic of what is called 'Modern JS' [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/javascript/modern-js). Throughout the curriculum we will be expecting you to use the modern syntax as that is most likely what you will be programming in. You can skip the sections that are about Promises and async/await for now, we will get there in the Using API's module. There is also a section on the history of JavaScript in there, you do not need to know this but we recommend it if you have some time to spare as it is very interesting.

Now that we are getting into more and more complex code it is also a good idea to learn a structured way to solve more complex problems. Have a look at the page on problem solving in your study book over [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/problem-solving-process).

## Finished?

Are you finished with going through the materials? Give yourself a pat on the back because you rock! It is time to combine everything you have learned and start practicing them vigorously. Have a look at the exercises [here](./MAKEME.md) and try to make as many of them as you can. This week there will be homework to do and hand in, so don't forget to do that! If you haven't set up the homework repository yet, have a look at your class repo.
