## **1. JS Tutor**

Practice, practice, practice. This week you are not handing in any assignment, but are going to practice as much javascript as you can. Play around with the exercises mentioned below, remember that you can copy the code into [JS Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) to step through the code. Or look at it in the debugger in the browser/vscode.

## **2. Practice the concepts**

In this section you will be doing interactive exercises, that will allow you to practice with the concepts you've learned about this week! We provide a lot of possible exercises here and you probably can't do everything, but do as many as you need to feel comfortable with the concepts. Also feel free to come back to them later.

- Do all parts of [Codecademy: Arrays](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/arrays) (Signup required!)
- Do 5 exercises of [FreeCodeCamp: Basic data structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-data-structures)
- [Codecademy: Functions ](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions)
- [JSchallenger](https://www.jschallenger.com/) - Do all of the Javascript Basics section except for `scope` and `asynchronous javascript`.
- There is a practice-exercises folder in this week's repository that is filled with exercises to try out. The solutions are in a separate folder so you can check if you did it correctly. Clone this repository to your computer and have a go!

## **3. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your cohort and your Q&A mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `JavaScript` fork, go to the folder `Week1`. Inside that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **4. Practice practice practice**

Done with the above? Then it is time to practice practice practice! Below you will find huge lists of practice exercises to keep practicing. The better you get at JavaScript, the easier the rest of the curriculum is so try to do as much as you can. Some of these solutions use some of the concepts of next week so if something looks weird, have a quick look at next week's topics to see what it means:

- [W3Resource Basic exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php) _(Note that the given solutions to these exercises use old JS syntax, we will learn more about this later. Most important now is that we don't use `var` anymore, so make sure you use `let` or `const`!)_

There are also multiple websites that provide constant challenges to practice your skills. These go from beginner to advanced and you should bookmark them and return every once in awhile. In some interview processes these kinds of exercises are given nowadays. We suggest to start with Edabit as they are more geared to beginners, the others start at a higher level:

- [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges) - You can choose JavaScript as a language and then try solving as many challenges as you can. If you find the level too easy then you can choose a higher difficulty.
- [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - Sign up and start solving!
- [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Once you feel comfortable with the JavaScript syntax sign up for code wars to practice. It is a website where you can solve exercises and rank up! When signing up, only choose JavaScript to really focus the problems on learning to solve problems in it. You can later change it to other technologies when you get more familiar.

## No assignment to hand in (for now)

For the first week of JavaScript there is no assignment to hand in as the exercises already give you all the feedback you need.

## Done early?

Try to do more exercises in the links above. The first weeks of the JavaScript modules are very important as understanding the basics will make the rest of the curriculum that much easier to follow. So keep reading and writing code!
