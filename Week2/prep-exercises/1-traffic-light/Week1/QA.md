# Q & A Session

The first week of JavaScript we do not have an assignment and we encourage trainees to follow all the material at their own pace. So trainees can ask questions about any week. Expect questions about:

- Functions
- Basic JavaScript blocks (let/const, operators, loops, if/else, functions)
- The Debugger (both browser/vscode) and how to debug
- Naming conventions
- DRY principle

In these first weeks, we want to get the trainees to create the right mental model for JavaScript constructs, so try to go back to basics as much as possible. However easy it comes to the mentors, this is the first time trainees encounter all the syntax of a programming language. So try to go slowly and use the debugger / [JSTutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) as much as possible.
