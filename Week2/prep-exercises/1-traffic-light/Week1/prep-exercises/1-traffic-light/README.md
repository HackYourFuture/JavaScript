# Prep exercise - traffic light

Let's have a deeper look at the working of traffic lights this week so that we can practice logic and loops. In `traffic-light-1.js` and `traffic-light-2.js` you will find the same requirements but with different ways of representing the traffic light. Have a look through the files and solve them so you can see how the way we represent data affects the way we need to solve problems.

## Things to think about

- Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?
- What happens if you change the loop to a `do-while` loop instead of a `while` loop? Why?
- We could have also used a `for` loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not?
