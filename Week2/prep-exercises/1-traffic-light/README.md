# Prep exercise - Traffic light

In the previous week we started with our traffic light. Now that we also know what a function is we have one last look at the workings of a traffic light in a different way. Take a look at the `traffic-light.js` file and implement the same requirements as last week again, but then with another different way of organising.

## Things to think about

- This time the loop was changed to a for loop that will run the code 6 times. Why was that needed?
- Why was the trafficLight added to the `main` function and not left at the top of the file?
- What do you think is the advantage of having the `getCurrentTrafficLightState` and `getNextStateIndex` functions?

# Module #2 - JavaScript

![JavaScript](./assets/javascript.png)

In this module you'll make a start into wonderful world of programming. We will be using the programming language `JavaScript` to do so. You'll learn about the basic building blocks of programming: `loops`, `functions`, `control flow` and more. Consider these as the ABC's of programming, without them it's impossible to write working software!

You'll be learning two main things:

1. **Fundamental concepts in programming**. While we're using JavaScript to illustrate these concepts, it's important to keep in mind that what you will learn is applicable to **any** programming language. They might differ in syntax (a fancy term for the arrangement of words in a language in order for it to make sense), but the functionality will be the same: a loop will always be a loop.

This should be your mindset when you're learning concepts: **I'm learning how to become a software developer that can adjust to any language used, because I know what the underlying principles and concepts are**.

2. **How to think like a programmer**. In one sentence this means: knowing how to solve problems computationally. Let's split that up in two parts: `how to solve problems` refers to the ability to identify issues and find effective solutions. `computationally` refers to the ability to think in logical steps that the computer can understand and execute.

This should be your mindset when you're learning how to think : **I'm learning how to think in logical steps, identifying cause and effect, and always looking for solutions**.

## Before you start!

### Install some new software!

In order to test your JavaScript code, you'll be using software that will execute your files from the command line. This software is called [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Download the Long-Term Support (LTS) version for your specific operating system.

After you've installed it, go to your command line interface. Type in the following command:

```
node --version
```

It should show you the version you are working with.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Have an idea of what `computer programming` is
- Know the basic building blocks of `JavaScript`
- Correctly write and use `variables`, `functions` and `loops`
- Understand the `control flow`
- Be able to solve worded problems using code

## How to use this repository

### Repository content

This repository consists of 2 essential parts for each week:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **while** working on the weekly assignment. It contains the list of concepts that you will want to study this week and points you to your study book to read all about them. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's practical tasks / assignment. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier. In the first two weeks we do not expect you to hand in any assignment as the online resources already check the code automatically, from week 3 our mentors will start giving you feedback on your assignments.

### How to study

Let's say you are just starting out with the JavaScript module. This is what you do...

1. The week always starts on **Wednesday**. First thing you'll do is open the `README.md` for that week. For the first week of `JavaScript`, that would be [Week1 Reading](/Week1/README.md)
2. You spend **Wednesday** and **Thursday** going over the resources and try to get a basic understanding of the concepts. In the meanwhile, you'll also implement any feedback you got on last week's assignment (from the HTML-CSS module)
3. On **Friday** you start with the assignment, found in the `MAKEME.md`. For the first week of `JavaScript`, that would be [Week1 Assignment](/Week1/MAKEME.md)
4. You spend **Friday** and **Saturday** playing around with the exercises and write down any questions you might have.
5. **DEADLINE 1**: You'll submit any questions you might have before **Saturday 23.59**, in the cohort channel.
6. On **Sunday** you'll attend the Q&A session. It'll be of the Q&A format, meaning that there will be no new material. Instead your questions shall be discussed and you can learn from others.
7. You spend **Monday** and **Tuesday** finalizing your assignment.
8. **DEADLINE 2**: You submit your assignment to the right channels (GitHub) before **Tuesday 23.59**. If you can't make it on time, please communicate it with your mentor
9. Start the new week by going back to point 1!
