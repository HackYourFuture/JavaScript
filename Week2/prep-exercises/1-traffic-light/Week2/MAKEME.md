# Assignment JavaScript Week 2

This will be the first week you are expected to hand in an assignment when we combine all of the concepts you have been practicing the last 3 weeks.

## **Todo list**

1. Prep exercises
1. Assignment
1. Practice practice practice

## **1. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your cohort and your Q&A mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `JavaScript` fork, go to the folder `Week2`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **2. Assignment**

It is time to combine everything we have learned the past couple of weeks and get some feedback from experienced developers. This will be the first week you are working with the assignment repository so reserve some time to set it up. You will find the repository in our [HackYourAssignment](https://github.com/HackYourAssignment/) GitHub page. There should be one called Assignment-cohortXX where XX is your cohort number, you will want to fork that to your own GitHub. Have a look at the [Assignment guide](../hand-in-assignments-guide.md) to see how to hand in your assignment.

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (JavaScript / Week 2).

_NOTE: Make sure to read and apply all of the steps in the README in the assignment repository to set up the extensions in Visual Studio Code!_.

## **3. Practice practice practice**

Done with the above? Then it is time to practice practice practice! Below you will find huge lists of practice exercises to keep practicing. The better you get at JavaScript, the easier the rest of the curriculum is so try to do as much as you can. Some of these solutions use some of the concepts of next week so if something looks weird, have a quick look at next week's topics to see what it means:

- [JSchallenger](https://www.jschallenger.com/) - Do the `scope` part in the `Basics` section. Then do the following in the Javascript Practice section (fundamentals, arrays, objects).
- [W3Resource - JavaScript Fundamental exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/fundamental/index.php)

Also keep going with all of the from beginner to advanced platforms mentioned last week!

## Done early?

Try to do more exercises in the links above. The first weeks of the JavaScript modules are very important as understanding the basics will make the rest of the curriculum that much easier to follow. So keep reading and writing code!
