# Q & A session

This week we are going deeper into more advanced topics, so expect questions about:

- Scope
- The Debugger (both browser/vscode) and how to debug functions
- DRY principle
- Naming conventions

In these first weeks we want to get the trainees to create the right mental model for JavaScript constructs, so try to go back to basics as much as possible. However easy it comes to the mentors, this is the first time trainees encounter all the syntax of a programming language. So try to go slowly and use the debugger / [JSTutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) as much as possible.
